# GHCB-Data-Visualization
This is a website containing graphs and statistics for a private discord server that has been active since 2014.

Data collected by Aaron and Chandler (friends - they data-mined manually) includes:
  - first messages for a select number of people
  - message count for a select number of people
  - common 'buzzwords'
  
You can view a deployment of it here: https://edanarredo.github.io/GHCB-Data-Visualization/

I'm still figuring out project structure 'etiquette' so I apologize if nevigating this repository is confusing (there aren't too many files anyways).

Technology Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4

This website is intended for private use and is incomplete.

Future Plans: 
  - Optimizing performance and loading times
  - improving hexagon icon appearance
  - improving website responsiveness for mobile devices
 
Take care!
